HTML Structure: The page is divided into <header>, <section> for features, and <footer>.
CSS Styling:
Global styles are applied to body and html.
The header is styled distinctively with a blue background and white text.
The features section uses Flexbox to create a responsive layout that adjusts between row and column styles based on the screen size.
Each feature is given a card-like design with a shadow, padding, and rounded corners.
The footer is styled with a darker background and is fixed at the bottom of the view.
This simple example sets up a visually appealing and functional landing page that can be expanded with more sections, interactive elements, and more detailed styling as needed.
